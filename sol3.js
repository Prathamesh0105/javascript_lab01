console.log(2 ^ 4);
/*In JavaScript, the ^ operator is the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of the numbers involved.

Here's the breakdown:

The binary representation of 2 is 10.
The binary representation of 4 is 100.
Performing bitwise XOR on these two binary numbers: 
The result of 2 ^ 4 in binary is 110, which is 6 in decimal.

Therefore, when you execute console.log(2 ^ 4);, it will output 6.

To perform exponentiation in JavaScript, you should use the ** operator instead. For example, console.log(2 ** 4); would correctly output 16, as it calculates 2 raised to the power of 4.
